  =================

This is criawips' cairo-based canvas (CCC). It was designed to be used as a
replacement for Gnome Canvas in my presentaiton application. It tries to remain
as easy to be used as Gnome Canvas but also to solve the problems that the
current Gnome Canvas API is infected with.

Requirements:
=============
 * Glib 2.10.0
 * GTK+ 2.8.0
 * cairo 1.2.0
 * check (optional)
 * gtk-doc (optional)

Features:
=========

 * Gnome Canvas like API
   * but now using things like gnome_canvas_item_new()
 * finer grained event handling API
 * every canvas item can be a container
 * model/view split
 * access to events on the view widget (no need for GnomeCanvasAcetate)
