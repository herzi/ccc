canvas:
  * show/hide
  * rename "bounds" signals
  * make the "path" vfunc of the CcShape a signal so people can post-process it,
    fix the bounds function to use path

demo:
  * show/hide demo

tests:
  * add a CcTestView that renders into a GdkWindow so we can safely emit events
    from there
