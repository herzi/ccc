    <para>
      To add support for %GDK_EVENT_ENTER and %GDK_EVENT_LEAVE events, we need
      some caching mechanism that stores the last element, so our synthesized
      events can always appear in pairs.
    </para>

    <para>
      On every %GDK_EVENT_MOTION event we look for the deepest nested child
      that lies under the pointer. This will be store in the @current field
      of the #CcViewWidget. If that changes, %GDK_EVENT_ENTER and
      %GDK_EVENT_LEAVE events get emitted.
