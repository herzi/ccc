    <para>
      Every item stores three bounding rectangles. The easiest one is it's own
      extents; this one the the one that items set before emitting the
      'notify::bounds' signal.
    </para>

    <para>
      Then there is the rectangle which contains the union on all the
      children's rectangles. This one is automatically updated when child items
      emit the 'notify::all-bounds' signal. If it changes, the
      'notify::children-bounds' signal will get emitted.
    </para>

    <para>
      If one of the former two changes, the third one will be updated
      automatically, as it is the rectangle which contains both the items
      extents and the ones from its children. If this rectangle changes, the
      'notify::all-bounds' signal gets emitted.
    </para>

    <para>
      Custom item implementations don't need to take care about the last two.
      These are updated automatically by the CcItem class, so you really care
      only about the extents of your implemented item.
