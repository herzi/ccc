/**
 * pango_layout_new_cairo:
 *
 * Creates a new #PangoLayout to be rendered to a cairo context. This is a
 * stripped down version of pango_cairo_create_layout() which doesn't call
 * pango_cairo_update_context() on the layout.
 *
 * This should not be harmful as long as you update the layout EVERY time you
 * want to render it to a cairo context.
 *
 * This method can be used to make life easier for objects which are tied very
 * closely to a #PangoLayout so they can create the layout in the init function
 * of the instance.
